I am a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona since September 2016.
Check out my [CV](/cv.html) for more information.

After working on applying machine learning on molecular dynamics for the last years I am currently intrigued
by the applications of neural networks and deep learning on a variety of problems including biological problems.

## Interests

1. [Coding](http://github.com/stefdoerr). I like coding in many different languages. My current favourite is Python. 
1. [Research](/research.html). The last years I have focused on research on molecular dynamics simulations.
1. [Music](https://fanfarrai.bandcamp.com/). I like playing the trumpet and especially traditional and balkan music.
1. [Dancing](). I teach argentinian tango for students at the [PRBB](http://www.prbb.org) institute.
